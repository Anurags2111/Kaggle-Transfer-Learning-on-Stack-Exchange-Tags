# Transfer Learning on Stack Exchange Tags
https://www.kaggle.com/c/transfer-learning-on-stack-exchange-tags

## Description
What does physics have in common with biology, cooking, cryptography, diy, robotics, and travel? If you answered "all pursuits are governed by the immutable laws of physics" we'll begrudgingly give you partial credit. If you answered "all were chosen randomly by a scheming Kaggle employee for a twisted transfer learning competition", congratulations, we accept your answer and mark the question as solved.

In this project, we're provided with the titles, text, and tags of Stack Exchange questions from six different sites. We're then asked for tag predictions on unseen physics questions.

In this dataset, you are provided with question titles, content, and tags for Stack Exchange sites on a variety of topics (biology, cooking, cryptography, diy, robotics, and travel). The content of each question is given as HTML. The tags are words or phrases that describe the topic of the question.

The test set is comprised of questions from the physics.stackexchange.com. For each question in the test set, we should use the title and question content in order to generate potential tags.
